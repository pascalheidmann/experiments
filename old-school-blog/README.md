# What is this

This is a simple (and very bad) blog system. Don't even think about using anything of this EVER in a product please ;)
It is thought as example code
to show how to improve even such a bad piece of code with a little bit of refactoring and introducing dependency
injection.

## Run it

```bash
composer update
php -S localhost:8000 public/index.php
```

OR use the `docker-compose.yml` file to run it with docker.
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
